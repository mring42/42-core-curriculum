Hostname, Users and Groups

The hostname must be your_intra_login42, but the hostname must be changed during the Born2beroot evaluation. The following commands might help:

$ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <new_hostname>
$ hostnamectl status

There must be a user with your_intra_login as username. During evaluation, you will be asked to create, delete, modify user accounts. The following commands are useful to know:

    useradd : creates a new user.
    usermod : changes the user’s parameters: -l for the username, -c for the full name, -g for groups by group ID.
    userdel -r : deletes a user and all associated files.
    id -u : displays user ID.
    users : shows a list of all currently logged in users.
    cat /etc/passwd | cut -d ":" -f 1 : displays a list of all users on the machine.
    cat /etc/passwd | awk -F '{print $1}' : same as above.

The user named your_intra_login must be part of the sudo and user42 groups. You must also be able to manipulate user groups during evaluation with the following commands:

    groupadd : creates a new group.
    gpasswd -a : adds a user to a group.
    gpasswd -d : removes a user from a group.
    groupdel : deletes a group.
    groups : displays the groups of a user.
    id -g : shows a user’s main group ID.
    getent group : displays a list of all users in a group.
